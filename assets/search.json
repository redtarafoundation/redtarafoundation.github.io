The anbik is also called the raʾs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

For later chemists it denotes various parts of crude distillation devices.\n\n\n\nAlembic drawings appear in works of Cleopatra the Alchemist, Synesius, and Zosimos of Panopolis. There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers.[4] According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.[5]\n\nThe anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his Kitab al-Filaha (Book of Agriculture), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.[2]\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "content": "\n  \n  \n\n\nRed Tara Encyclopædia\n\nTara is the female buddha. The methods we use to attain the enlightened qualities of Tara have been passed down through many perfect lineages of highly realized Tibetan Buddhist practitioners.\n\nThis compendium aims to track all available information on the Red Tara cycle (a terma revealed by Apong Terton); and to present it in a structured form. We make aspirations that this could benefit students that want to go deeper in their studies and practice.\n\nStart here:\n\n\n  Who is Red Tara?\n  The history of Red Tara\n  How to practice Red Tara meditation?\n  Teachers and Dharma Centers\n\n\nColophon\n\nThe Red Tara Encyclopædia is an open-source project built upon the effort of voluntaries. If you feel that you can help us in any way, feel free to reach us at hello@redtara.org.\n\nWho we are: we are students of Red Tara, revealed by the great Nyingmapa lama Apong Terton, and taught in the West by Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche. This is an independent project with no formal connections to Chagdud Gonpa or any other Dharma center that upholds this lineage.\n\nAuthenticity: all content was written accordingly to public teachings and resources of authentic Dharma teachers. You may want to check our article guidelines as well as our vision and motivation for this project. If you believe that any information on this website is incorrect or lack references, please contact us.\n\nTechnology: this website runs by the generosity and interdependence of inumerous developers and open-source activists of the past. It’s built with Jekyll and hosted by Github Pages. We use a boilerplate theme called Alembic by David Darnes.\n\nTipography: the body is composed in Georgia Serif, designed in 1993 by Matthew Carter and Tom Rickner for the Microsoft Corporation. Headings are in Merriweather Serif, a contemporary classic designed by Eben Sorkin.
